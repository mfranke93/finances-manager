==============================================================================

Version 1.4.3                                           *v1.4.3*
Release date: August 21st, 2017

Added some robustness regarding the valid number of categories. Removed
deprecated pre-C++11 statements.

==============================================================================

Version 1.4.2                                           *v1.4.2*
Release date: August 14th, 2017

Implemented an internal backup restore, accessible via a button in the menu
bar.

==============================================================================

Version 1.4.1                                           *v1.4.1*
Release date: June 18th, 2017

Fixed a autoscroll issue where adding new items would not scroll all the way
down in the table view for very large tables (>512 entries). Also implemented
an internal backup button functionality.

==============================================================================

Version 1.4.0                                           *v1.4.0*
Release date: March 28th, 2017

Added persistent settings and multi-item entry.

New features:
  - Can now set a custom database location (no longer hardcoded) and a default
    plot type. This can be set in the Settings dialog accessible via the menu
    bar. Also, there is a file ~/.config/finances-manager/config which stores
    those settings persistently.  IMPORTANT: The directory
    ~/.config/finances-manager must exist for this version of the application
    to work!
  - Can now enter multiple items for one recipient and date in one go.
    Previously, this would have meant adding one item at a time and select the
    correct date and recipient each time. Now, it is possible to add a new
    subitem, with its own name, price and category.

==============================================================================

Version 1.3.2                                           *v1.3.2*
Release date: March 23rd, 2017

Fixed a bug where recipients without any items associated (i.e. newly created
recipients) would not show up in the search list due to an SQL join discarding
them as results.

==============================================================================

Version 1.3.1                                           *v1.3.1*
Release date: March 20th, 2017

Improved search function for recipients by ordering results by descending
number of times used. This makes it easier to select recipients which are used
more often, like a favorite super market, or a monthly recipient for salary,
rent, etc.

==============================================================================

Version 1.3                                             *v1.3*
Release date: March 13th, 2017

This adds a search for recipients and fixes some bugs.

New features:
  - Changed the combo box with all recipients in the AddItemDialog to a button
    which would trigger a search dialog. Here, the recipient may be added, or
    searched for by a simple text search. If a recipient has been selected, it
    is displayed on the button.
  - The AddItemDialog's Okay button will now only be enabled after a valid
    item name, item price and recipient have been entered and selected.

Bugfixes:
  - Fixed a bug where zooming in past a certain zoomlevel would make the last
    few pixels of the plot be drawn outside of the visible area.
  - Fixed a bug with the Qt Sqlite drivers only executing certain operations
    for the first 256 lines of a query or table. Previously, reloading the
    table view or adding new items to it with a table size larger than 256
    would lead to the last rows of the table being resized to a larger height,
    and the scroll area not properly scrolled all the way down.

==============================================================================

Version 1.2                                             *v1.2*
Release date: January 8th, 2017

This adds and improves some features.

New features:
  - Cursor hovering in plot and bar graph gives information on the data at
    that point. Formerly, there was only a generic greeting in the popup.
  - Moved plotting classes to their own dedicated module. Plotting is now done
    in a more abstract way, enabling implementation of different plotting
    styles that are hot swappable. Added a combo box to select plotting style.
  - Added a plotting style which shows the summed plus' and minus' of each day
    as it's own peak. This is now selectable together with the "standard"
    cumulative plot.
  - Added a menu bar with some select items in it.
  - The table view now makes negative numbers red and aligns the minus at the
    far left of the cell.
  - Reduced the default zoom level for the plot by one.
  - Minor fixes and improvements.

==============================================================================

Version 1.1                                             *v1.1*
Release date: November 17th, 2016

This adds some features to the core program.

New features:
  - New tab for bar graph showing distribution of income and expenditures over
    the different categories.
  - It is now possible to only plot a selection of categories, instead of all.
  - It is now possible to only plot data from a certain date range. This
    feature exists for the bar graph as well.
  - Added an internal color scheme for the bar graph bars.

==============================================================================
